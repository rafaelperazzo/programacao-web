<p>Here you set the files that are needed to prepare the execution,
debug or assessment of a submission. This includes scripting files,
program test files and data files.</p>
<h2>Default script to run or debug</h2>
<p>If you don't set script files for run or  debug submissions, the system
will resolve the language you use (based on file name extensions) and use a
predefined script.
<h2>Automatic evaluation</h2>
<p>The incorporates features to facilitate the evaluation of student's submissions.
This feature allows to run the student program and check its output for a given input.
To set up the evaluation cases you must populate the file &quot;vpl_evaluate.cases&quot;.
<p>The file "vpl_evaluate.cases" has the following format:
<ul>
<li> "<strong>case </strong>= Description of case": Optional. Set an start of test case definition.</li>
<li> "<strong>input </strong>= text": can use several lines. Ends with other instruction.</li>
<li> "<strong>output </strong>= text": can use several lines. Ends with other instruction. A case can have differents correct output. There are three types of output: numbers, text and exact test:
<ul>
<li> <strong>number</strong>: defined as sequence of numbers (integers and floats). Only numbers in the output are checked, other text are ignored. Floats are checked with tolerance</li>
<li> <strong>text</strong>: defined as text without double quote. Only words are checked and the rest of chars are ignored, the comparation is case-insensitive </li>
<li> <strong>exact text</strong>: defined as text into double quote. The exact match is used to test the output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> "<strong>grade reduction</strong> = [value|percentage%]" : By default an error reduces student's grade
(starts with maxgrade) by (grade_range/number of cases) but with this instruction you can change
the reduction value or percentage.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>General use</h2>
<p>A new file can be added by writing its name in the box  &quot;<b>Add file</b>&quot;
and then clicking on the button &quot;<b>Add file</b>&quot;.</p>
<p>An existing file can be uploaded by means of the  &quot;<b>Upload file</b>&quot;.<p>All the added  or uploaded files can
be edited, and all of them, except the three scripting files mentioned
below, can be renamed or deleted.</p>
<h2>Manual run, execute or evaluation</h2>
<p>Three scripting files to prepare each of the actions may be set.
These files have predefined names: <b>vpl_run.sh</b> (execution),
<b>vpl_debug.sh</b>  (debug) and <b>vpl_evaluate.sh</b> (assessment).</p>
<p>The execution of any of those scripting files should generate a
file named <b>vpl_execution</b>.
This file must be a binary executable or a script beginning with &quot;#!/bin/sh &quot;.
The non-generation of this file impedes to run the selected action.</p>
<p>If the activity that you are configuring is "based on" other activity,
the files of the base activity are added automatically.
The contents of the vpl_run.sh, vpl_debug.sh and vpl_evaluate.sh files
are concatenated from the deepest level of "based on" to the current.</P>
<p>Finally, the file <b>vpl_environment.sh</b> is automatically added.
This scripting file contain information about the submission.
The information come as environment variables: </p>
<ul> <li> LANG:  used language. </li>
<li> LC_ALL: same value as LANG. </li>
<li> VPL_MAXTIME: maximum execution time in seconds. </li>
<li> VPL_FILEBASEURL: URL to access the files of the course. </li>
<li> VPL_SUBFILE#:  each name of the files submitted by the student. # Ranges from 0 to number of submitted files. </Li>
<li> VPL_SUBFILES: list of all submitted files. </li>
<li> VPL_VARIATION + id: where id is the variation order starting with 0 and the value is the value of the variation. </li>
</ul>
If the action requested is evaluation, then the following vars are added too.
<ul>
	<li>VPL_MAXTIME: max time of execution in seconds.</li>
	<li>VPL_MAXMEMORY: max memmory usable</li>
	<li>VPL_MAXFILESIZE: max file size in byte that can be create.</li>
	<li>VPL_MAXPROCESSES: max number of procceses that can be run simultaneous.</li>
	<Li>VPL_FILEBASEURL: URL to the course files.</Li>
	<li>VPL_GRADEMIN: Min grade for this activity</li>
	<li>VPL_GRADEMAX: Max grade for this activity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assessment result</h2>
<p>Evaluation output is processed to extract, if possible, comments and a proposed grade for the assessment.
Comments can be set in two ways: with a line comment defined by a line beginning with 'Comment :=&gt;&gt;' or
with block comments starting with a line containing only '&lt;|--' and ending with a line containing only '--|&gt;'.
The grade is taken from the last line that begins with 'Grade :=&gt;&gt;'.
